## Leaky Secrety

All secrets are either generated or modified, and originals are no longer valid

### GitHub

I once had a PAT whose value is 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

Another oopsie: ghp_RqviGaIw6NW5CJgMWsAB0HiqjVbkgY3xASDF

I then made a fine grained pat with no permissions. Its name was 
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

### DevOps 

Blah blah blah, devops pat was leaked, oh no!
